# Exam-System

This is a interactive basic Java Swing application that simulates a multiple-choice exam interface, complete with a question display area, navigation buttons, and answer selection.

## HIGHLIGHTS 
- Graphical user interface using Java Swing.
- Displays text multiple-choice questions with an options panel and a start button panel.
- Detects correct and incorrect answers to give feedback.
- Track progress to decide whether to move on to the next question or complete the exam or prompt an error message.
- Using layouts such as 'JPanel', 'BorderLayout', 'GridLayout', and 'JTextArea'.
- Questions focus on the basic foundation of intermediate Java programming concepts and learning objectives that I gained from my college Java course. 

  ## CONCEPTS USED
  -Java (OOP).
  -Java Swing ('JFrame ', 'JPanel', 'JTextArea', 'JButton').
  -AWT Event Handling ('ActionListener', 'ActionEvent').
  -Array and 'ArrayList' data handling.
  
 ## HOW IT WORKS
  1. Run 'ExamSystem.Java.'
  2. Click 'Start Exam.'
  3. View the questions and select an answer.
  4. Get instant feedbackâ€”correct answers move to the next question, and incorrect answers prompt the user to try again.
  5. A completion message appears once done with the exam.

## FUTURE FIXES AND PROGRAM UPDATES
- Getting the question and answer choices to keep displaying themselves once the user is prompted to try again and choose a different answer option.
-Keeping score.
- Displaying the full exam score at the end with some cool graphics.
-Give the exam system a more attractive look.
